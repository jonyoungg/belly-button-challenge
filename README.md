This project provides interactive visualizations of microbiome data using Python and Plotly. The data, sourced from a JSON file, includes information on different samples and their associated OTU (Operational Taxonomic Units) data. The main goal of the project is to offer an intuitive way to explore the microbiome samples through visual representations.

The visualizations include a bar chart and a bubble chart. The bar chart displays the top 10 OTUs for a selected sample, allowing users to easily compare sample values and OTU IDs. The bubble chart, on the other hand, provides a more detailed view of the entire dataset by plotting OTU IDs against sample values, where the size of the bubbles reflects the sample values and the color distinguishes between different OTUs.

Users can interact with these visualizations through dropdown menus, which let them switch between different samples and explore the corresponding data. This makes the project both flexible and informative, providing an engaging way to analyze microbiome data.
